# xBay Marketplace

Welcome to the xBay Marketplace, a straight forward application where Users can create [Listings](src/main/java/com/xbaychallenge/listing/repository/ListingEntity.java) for stuff they want to sell and place [Offers](src/main/java/com/xbaychallenge/offer/repository/OfferEntity.java) to sellers. 
If you look closely, you will notice that it is still in a prototype state. It has it's flaws... but that is exactly what we want to talk about with you in your upcoming Tech Interview.

## How to prepare for the Tech Interview

Please check out this project to your local machine and set it up in an IDE of your choice. Go through the code and note down all stuff you like and you don't like. You don't need to write any code before the session.

## What is the plan for the session?

We will ask you to share your screen and get your opinion on the code, to start off a conversation about it. It might happen, that we have some tickets prepared for you, to be implemented live in this project. Don't worry, it is not about shredding hunderts of lines or any other crazy stunt. Remember: It is about a conversion.
A small hint: You are free to use any tool you would use during any other regular working day: Google, Bing, ChatGPT.... ok, it would be nice if you could skip the part where you ping your current co-workers ;-) 
Ready to go? We are looking forward to :-)

## What you will need to run it locally:
- A Java 17+ SDK
- Docker (hence the [docker-compose.yml] to run the required DB instance)
- An IDE of your choice. (Yes, VI is cool and nerdy. But please use something from the current decade!)
